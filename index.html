             <h2> The struggle is real!</h2>
             <p>I grew up doing almost every sport and clubs at high school, Louisiana Missorui, as well as honor classes, bowling, and various of outside activities; I've always enjoyed learning and love taking oppertunities, however my passions always never seem to overlap!</p>

            <h3>Astrology, and foraging and crafting- oh my!</h3>
            <p>I've found a special interest in astrology; understanding people through their stars, foraging; going out to harvest plants and different findings in the woods, and crafting different various cacoctions such as the Three Thieves Viniger and garlic infused honey. (both great for colds!)
               I grew up as a wiccan, so nature and working with the earth has always been a huge part of who I am. It's so fun getting to learn about how different plants help with what illment. The best part though...? Making my friends be my ginnie pigs as I try out different tonics and lotions.

            <h4>Computers, phones, mythology</h4>
            <p id = "funParagraph">As growing up wiccan, I was also fastinated by technology and how it worked. I became the fastest typer in my class and studied different computer parts in high school so that I could gloat that teachers asked for my help. (Cause who wouldn't as a teenager?) Due to the fact I also come from a small sacluded town, Louisiana Missorui, it was nice to find a passion of mine was helping others. Now, why did I add mythology to the mix? How else am I supposed to learn about cryptics?? Watch the best cryptic videos? Read an article about a book informing about different lil cryptics? My tech will.</p>

            <h5>An Entertainer?!</h5>
            <p>I love being the center of attention sometimes and used to stream a lot on my freetime! My streamer tag was BitterCandy45. Fans called me Bitter, friends called me Candy. I had a blast playing and getting to network around to meet new people. Once I get a stable job, I have plans on going back to streaming and continue to content create. Although it was tedious, it was rewarding to use my pattern tracking skills to find various of hashtags/sounds that people were using to get my streams to viewers. I've made the best of friends whom I can call family awhile streaming and excited to see where else it can take me! Click the picture to be sent to my stream! (unactive for now)</p>
